Exploratory-Data
================

All files pertaining to the projects in Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis course.

The UCI data on power consumption at homes is used, as forked from https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

Place all the files in the same directory as the raw dataset from UCI.
Run the 'getandclean.R' file to produce a clean data set from the raw file.
Run each plot script to generate their respective png plots.

Due to some GitHub issues I was unable to upload the png files directly to the repo. 
I have however provided links to my outputs uploaded to a third party site. These are available for validation in plotlinks.txt
